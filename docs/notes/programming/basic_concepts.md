## Data and Functions
We use computers to visualize, transform, and convert data. For example, in Rhino3D you might scale (transform) a 2D box representing a room (data).

We can generalize these processes into two types of elements. 
* **Data** - The stuff we want to transform, visualize, read, write, etc.
* **Functions** - The sequence of actions to be performed on data.

## Programming

**Programming** is the act of telling computers to do perform actions (functions) on stuff (data) using a written, formally defined *syntax* called a programming language. A **programming language** is the *system of notation for writing programs.* A program written in a programming language is meant to be compiled or interpreted by computers, but *read* by people.

As such, a programming language needs provide a way for people to "organize our ideas about computational processes."[^1] Just as words, sentences, paragraphs, plot tropes, and genres help structure and organize written language, programming languages have ways of combining simple ideas into more complex ones.

* **primitive expressions and statements**, which represent the simplest building blocks that the language provides,
* **means of combination**, by which compound elements are built from simpler ones, and
* **means of abstraction**, by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units. [^1]

## Expressions and Statements

**Expressions** and **statements** are basic units of how we interact with data and functions in programming. Expressions are *evaluated*. Statements are *executed.*
